    <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Pages Site</h1>
    <p>Hello, I‚Äôm Morgan

I am a graduate student in the Host Microbe Interactions MSc program, at the University of Thessaly Greece, where I am fortunate to work with Professor Konstantinos (Kostas) kormas at the Microbial Communities and Habitats in Aquatic Environments Laboratory (MiCHAEL), where I studied bovine gut microbial composition and structure using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics.

I am interested in using high-throughput microbiome and metagenomic sequencing, along with novel computational methods, to study how humans and animals interact with their microbiomes, particularly:

üß¨ Use of next-generation computational metagenomic tools that enables high-resolution microbiome profiling and large-scale comparative genomics of uncharacterized microbes.
üë∂ Microbiome transmission between environments, focusing on vertical transfer from mother to offspring at birth and horizontal transfer between individuals sharing the same environment.
ü¶† Microbiome influence on pathogen virulence and antibiotic resistance in infections by integrating longitudinal microbiome and pathogen sequencing.
Previously, I was a Research Assistant at Michael Okpara University of Agriculture in Nigeria, where I worked on dietary modulation of the rumen microbiome. I also received Master of Science degree in Animal Science from University of Nigeria, and Bachelor of Agriculture degree in Animal Science from Federal University of Technology Owerri.

I'm always open to discussing science and exploring collaboration opportunities. Feel free to contact me via email...</p>
