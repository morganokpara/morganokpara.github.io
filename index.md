**Hello, Iâ€™m Morgan**

I am a graduate student in the [Host Microbe Interactions MSc program](https://hosmic.uth.gr), at the University of Thessaly Greece, where I am fortunate to work with [Professor Konstantinos (Kostas) kormas](http://diae.uth.gr/Home/ViewProfile?link=kormas-konstantinos-kathigitis-dr_5) at the [Microbial Communities and Habitats in Aquatic Environments Laboratory (MiCHAEL)](https://sites.google.com/site/kkormas), where I studied bovine gut microbial composition and structure using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics.

I am interested in using high-throughput microbiome and metagenomic sequencing, along with novel computational methods, to study how humans and animals interact with their microbiomes, particularly:
- ðŸ§¬ Use of next-generation computational metagenomic tools that enables high-resolution microbiome profiling and large-scale comparative genomics of uncharacterized microbes.  
- ðŸ‘¶ Microbiome transmission between environments, focusing on vertical transfer from mother to offspring at birth and horizontal transfer between individuals sharing the same environment. 
- ðŸ¦  Microbiome influence on pathogen virulence and antibiotic resistance in infections by integrating longitudinal microbiome and pathogen sequencing.  

Previously, I was a Research Assistant at [Michael Okpara University of Agriculture](https://mouau.edu.ng) in Nigeria, where I worked on dietary modulation of the rumen microbiome. I also received Master of Science degree in Animal Science from [University of Nigeria](https://www.unn.edu.ng), and Bachelor of Agriculture degree in Animal Science from [Federal University of Technology Owerri](https://futo.edu.ng).

I'm always open to discussing science and exploring collaboration opportunities. Feel free to contact me via email..
