# Welcome 👋
Hello, I’m **Morgan**.  
I am a graduate student in the **Host Microbe Interactions MSc program**, at the University of Thessaly Greece, where I am fortunate to work with **Professor Konstantinos (Kostas) kormas** at the *Microbial Communities and Habitats in Aquatic Environments Laboratory (MiCHAEL)*.
I am interested in using high-throughput microbiome and metagenomic sequencing, along with novel computational methods, to study how humans and animals interact with their microbiomes, particularly:
- 🧬 Use of next-generation computational metagenomic tools that enables high-resolution microbiome profiling and large-scale comparative genomics of uncharacterized microbes.  
- 👶 Microbiome transmission between environments, focusing on vertical transfer from mother to offspring at birth and horizontal transfer between individuals sharing the same environment.  
- 🦠 Microbiome influence on pathogen virulence and antibiotic resistance in infections by integrating longitudinal microbiome and pathogen sequencing.

### 🔬 Previous Work
Previously, I was a Research Assistant at *Michael Okpara University of Agriculture in Nigeria*, where I worked on dietary modulation of the rumen microbiome to mitigate ruminant enteric methane emissions.
I also received my **Master of Science** in Animal Science from *University of Nigeria*, and **Bachelor of Agricultural Technology** from *Federal University of Technology Owerri*.
