**Understanding Microbiome Dynamics and Host-Microbe Interactions in Humans and Food Animals using novel computational and high-throughput genomic approaches**

Currently, my research in the [Microbial Communities and Habitats in Aquatic Environments Laboratory (MiCHAEL) Lab]( https://sites.google.com/site/kkormas/) focuses on several key aspects of human and animal microbiome:


- Hosts and how they interact with their microbial communities.
- Investigating the transmission and acquisition patterns of human microbiota.
- Microbiome influences pathogen virulence and antibiotic resistance.
